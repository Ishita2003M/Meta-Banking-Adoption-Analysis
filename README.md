# Meta-Banking-Adoption-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-

Adoption Intention vs. Demographics: 
Does age, gender, or education level influence the intention to use meta-banking (Int1 to Int4)?

Perceived Ease of Use and Usefulness: 
Are people more likely to adopt meta-banking if they perceive it as easy to use (PEU1 to PEU4)?

Trust and Technostress: 
How do various dimensions of trust (Trt1-Trt4) predict adoption intention?
Does technostress (as measured by Str1-Str4) negatively correlate with adoption intention?
